### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows

## 📝 Configuration

If your app uses environment variables (e.g., API keys), create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file or set environment variables manually:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

You can access these in your app using:

```python
import streamlit as st
api_key = st.secrets["api_key"]
```
